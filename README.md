# C++ CMetaProgrammer

Welcome to the C++ CMetaProgrammer! CMetaProgrammer is a toolkit that allows you to dynamically generate code snippets and structures in C++.

## Features

- **Code Template**: Define templates with placeholders to create dynamic code.
- **Code Builder**: Build code dynamically with support for indentation and control flow.
- **Code Generator**: Generate function and class definitions using provided templates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- CMake (version >= 3.10)
- C++11-compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

### Building CMetaProgrammer

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/cpp-cmetaprogrammer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd cpp-cmetaprogrammer
   ```

3. **Create a build directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

4. **Generate build files with CMake**:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

5. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests, execute the following command from the build directory:

```bash
./test_cmetaprogrammer
```

### Usage

1. **Include the necessary headers** in your C++ code:

   ```cpp
   #include "CodeTemplate.hpp"
   #include "CodeBuilder.hpp"
   #include "CodeGenerator.hpp"
   ```

2. **Use the provided classes** to generate code dynamically as needed.

### Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of CMetaProgrammer:

```cpp
